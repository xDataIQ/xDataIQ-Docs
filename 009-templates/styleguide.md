* Sub-chapters need to increase the number of `#` in the title according to
  their nesting depth.
* All words in the page's title must be capitalized, except for conjunctions
  like "of" and "and" .

## Picking words

* Use "will" over "would" when describing outcomes.
* Prefer "in the ___ process" over "on".

## Field references

The following rules only apply to the documentation of object's fields.

### Page title

Each page must use the actual object name as the title, such as `Sales Invoice`, `Purchase Invoice`, and `Sales Credit Memo`.

Under the page tile must be a one-line description starting with `>`.

Using `session` as example:

```markdown
# session

> Manage browser sessions, cookies, cache, proxy settings, etc.
```
